I built this project for my adult Japanese class to help me learn hiragana and katakana, and also to get some basic experience with Vue. It's deployed to GitHub Pages.

My initial impression of Vue was _okay_? I could see how I can do everything I do in React, but I don't immediately see any specific reasons why I would use it over React.
